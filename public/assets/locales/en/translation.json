We empower people, including peer-based staff who have firsthand experience with addiction, recovery, or houselessness, to reintegrate into society. Our non-judgmental approach ensures their safety and active participation in the community. Through lasting solutions, we support individuals in transitioning into stable housing, offering mentorship, resources for housing stability, and food to foster a thriving and inclusive community.",
